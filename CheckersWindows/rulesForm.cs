The object of the game is to prevent the opponent from being able to move when it is his turn to do so. \nThis is accomplished either by capturing all of the opponent's pawns, or by blocking those that remain so that none of them can be moved. \nIf neither player can accomplish this, the game is a draw." + Environment.NewLine +
